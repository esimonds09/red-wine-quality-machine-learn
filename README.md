## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using a linear regression model. By understanding the relationships between chemical attributes and wine quality, we can provide insights for wine producers to enhance their production processes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Wine Quality dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) from Kaggle. It contains chemical properties and quality ratings for red and white wines.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esimonds09/red-wine-quality-prediction.git
cd red-wine-quality-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
